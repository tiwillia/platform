### Submit Code Changes

Code contributions should:

- Follow our code standards (see below)
- Include tests where applicable
- Update documentation as needed
- Pass all CI/CD checks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- Go 1.24+ (for backend/operator development)
- Node.js 20+ and npm (for frontend development)
- Python 3.11+ (for runner development)
- Podman or Docker (for building containers)
- Kind and kubectl (for local development)
- Git for version control

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vTeam.git
   cd vTeam
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ambient-code/vTeam.git
   ```

### Install Git Hooks (Recommended)

We use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework to run linters and branch protection checks automatically on every commit. Install with:

```bash
make setup-hooks
```

Or run the installation script directly:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

**What runs on every commit:**

- **File hygiene** - trailing whitespace, EOF fixer, YAML validation, large file check, merge conflict markers, private key detection
- **Python** - `ruff format` + `ruff check --fix` (runners and scripts)
- **Go** - `gofmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` (backend, operator, public-api)
- **Frontend** - ESLint (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- **Branch protection** - blocks commits to `main`/`master`/`production`

**What runs on push:**

- **Push protection** - blocks pushes to `main`/`master`/`production`

**Run all hooks manually:**

```bash
make lint
# or: pre-commit run --all-files
```

If you need to override the hooks (e.g., for hotfixes):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "hotfix: critical fix"
git push --no-verify origin main
```

See [scripts/git-hooks/README.md](scripts/git-hooks/README.md) for more details.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always work on a feature branch, not `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code patterns and style
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Test your changes locally

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add multi-repo session support"
git commit -m "fix: resolve PVC mounting issue in kind cluster"
git commit -m "docs: update local development setup instructions"
git commit -m "test: add integration tests for operator"
```

Commit message prefixes:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync with upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Code Standards

### Go Code (Backend & Operator)

**Formatting:**
```bash
# Auto-format your code
gofmt -w components/backend components/operator
```

**Quality Checks:**
```bash
# Backend
cd components/backend
gofmt -l .                    # Check formatting (should output nothing)
go vet ./...                  # Detect suspicious constructs
golangci-lint run            # Run comprehensive linting

# Operator
cd components/operator
gofmt -l .
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run
```

**Install golangci-lint:**
```bash
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use explicit error handling, never `panic()` in production code
- Always use user-scoped Kubernetes clients for API operations
- Implement proper RBAC checks before resource access
- Never log sensitive data (tokens, API keys)
- Use `unstructured.Nested*` helpers for type-safe CR access
- Set OwnerReferences on child resources for automatic cleanup

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive backend/operator development standards.

### Frontend Code (NextJS)

```bash
cd components/frontend
npm run lint                  # ESLint checks
npm run build                 # Ensure builds without errors/warnings
```

**Best Practices:**

- Zero `any` types (use proper TypeScript types)
- Use Shadcn UI components only (no custom UI from scratch)
- Use React Query for ALL data operations (no manual `fetch()`)
- Use `type` over `interface`
- Colocate single-use components with their pages
- All buttons must show loading states
- All lists must have empty states
- All nested pages must have breadcrumbs

See [components/frontend/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md](components/frontend/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md) for complete frontend standards.

### Python Code (Runners)

```bash
cd components/runners/ambient-runner

# Format code
ruff format .

# Lint (with auto-fix)
ruff check --fix .
```

**Standards:**

- Use `ruff format` for formatting
- Use `ruff check` for linting
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Add type hints where appropriate

## Testing Requirements

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd components/backend
make test              # All tests
make test-unit         # Unit tests only
make test-contract     # Contract tests only
make test-integration  # Integration tests (requires k8s cluster)
make test-coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

### Operator Tests

```bash
cd components/operator
go test ./... -v
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd components/frontend
npm test
```

**Testing Guidelines:**

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure tests pass locally before pushing
- Aim for meaningful test coverage
- Write clear test descriptions
- Use table-driven tests in Go

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Run all quality checks** for the components you modified
2. **Run tests** and ensure they pass
3. **Update documentation** if you changed functionality
4. **Rebase on latest main** to avoid merge conflicts
5. **Test locally** with Kind if possible

### PR Description

Your PR should include:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Description** of what changed and why
- **Related issues** (use "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #123")
- **Testing performed** - how you verified the changes
- **Screenshots** (if UI changes)
- **Breaking changes** (if any)

### Review Process

- All PRs require at least one approval
- GitHub Actions will automatically run:
  - Go linting checks (gofmt, go vet, golangci-lint)
  - Component builds
  - Tests
- Address review feedback promptly
- Keep discussions focused and professional
- Be open to suggestions and alternative approaches

### After Approval

- Squash commits will happen automatically on merge
- Your PR will be merged to `main`
- Delete your feature branch after merge

## Local Development Setup

The recommended way to develop and test Ambient Code Platform locally is using **Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**. This provides a lightweight Kubernetes environment that matches our CI/CD setup.

### Installing Kind and Prerequisites

#### macOS

```bash
# Install using Homebrew
brew install kind kubectl docker
```

#### Linux

```bash
# Install kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# Install Kind
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/latest/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind

# Install Docker
# Follow: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
```

### Quick Start

Once Kind and prerequisites are installed, you can start the complete development environment with a single command:

#### First-Time Setup

```bash
make kind-up
```

This command will:
- Create Kind cluster (~30 seconds)
- Deploy all components (backend, frontend, operator)
- Set up ingress and port forwarding
- Load container images

The setup takes ~2 minutes on first run.

#### Access the Application

```bash
# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

Simple! Kind automatically sets up port forwarding to localhost.

#### Stopping and Restarting

Stop and delete the Kind cluster:

```bash
make kind-down
```

Restart:

```bash
make kind-up
```

### Additional Development Commands

**Check status:**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n ambient-code
kubectl get svc -n ambient-code
```

**View logs:**
```bash
kubectl logs -n ambient-code deployment/backend-api -f
kubectl logs -n ambient-code deployment/frontend -f
kubectl logs -n ambient-code deployment/agentic-operator -f
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
make kind-down         # Delete Kind cluster
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
make test-e2e          # Run E2E tests
```

## Troubleshooting

### Kind Cluster Issues

#### Cluster Won't Start

```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Delete and recreate cluster
make kind-down
make kind-up
```

#### Pods Not Starting

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n ambient-code

# View pod details
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n ambient-code

# Check logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n ambient-code
```

#### Port Forwarding Issues

```bash
# Check if port 8080 is in use
lsof -i :8080

# Restart port forwarding
make kind-down
make kind-up
```

#### Complete Reset

If Kind cluster is broken:

```bash
# Delete cluster
kind delete cluster --name ambient-code

# Recreate
make kind-up
```

### Application Issues

**Pods not starting:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ambient-code
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n ambient-code
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n ambient-code
```

**Image issues:**

```bash
# Check if images are loaded
docker exec -it ambient-code-control-plane crictl images | grep ambient
```

**Service not accessible:**

```bash
# Check services
kubectl get services -n ambient-code

# Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n ambient-code

# Test directly
kubectl port-forward -n ambient-code svc/frontend-service 3000:3000
```

**Networking issues:**

```bash
# Check ingress controller
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

# Restart port forwarding
make kind-down
make kind-up
```
